        <div class="history-section">
            <h2>Where We Began</h2>
            <p>McMinnville Pallet Co. was founded in 2003 by Justin Caten, who recognized the growing need for reliable pallet solutions in Tennessee's thriving agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Starting with a small facility Justin built their business on the principles of quality craftsmanship, honest service, and community partnership.</p>
            
            <p>What began as a modest operation producing standard pallets for local businesses has grown into a full-service pallet manufacturing and management company. Throughout our history, we've remained true to our founding values while embracing innovation and sustainability. In the early 2010s, we expanded our operations to include pallet recycling and refurbishing services, recognizing the importance of environmental stewardship long before it became an industry standard.</p>
            
            <p>Today, McMinnville Pallet Co. operates from a state-of-the-art 50,000 square-foot facility equipped with modern manufacturing equipment and a dedicated team of skilled craftsmen. We've built lasting relationships with businesses across diverse industries including wine and beverage distribution, food processing, manufacturing, agriculture, retail distribution, and logistics. Our family-owned company remains committed to providing personalized service, maintaining the highest quality standards, and supporting the communities we serve. As we look to the future, we continue to invest in sustainable practices, advanced technologies, and our greatest asset—our people—ensuring McMinnville Pallet Co. remains your trusted partner for generations to come.</p>
